All in and output files for simulating MD 1500 ns on a PBC HPC setup. The particular simulation is system P_kpi_m (that is solvated insulin 3x500 ns simulations continuing from each other). See thesis for further elaboration.


Omitting here the large .tpr and .trr files due to taking up too much space
