#### Further explanation, typo and  data corrections for Thesis "A Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin", all is otherwise consistent, please email me if seeing any discrepancy:


#### Further explanations or elaboration:

#### Miswritten text (unseen before publishing; bear in mind it's a 269 page document with intricate details)

- These related figures show correct nomenclature and numbering, just a few typos in following method and figure captions text:
  
  Method S4.2.1.1: PDB 6HN5, Insulin has 25 residues in B-chain (not 26). 
                   PDB 6CE9, aCT* are designated for chain P (aCT for chain M).

  Fig. S4.16, S4.17: Figure text aCT* should be aCT.

  Fig. S4.19, S4.23: Phrase "(lime-green, chain A; ochre-brown, chain B)" miswritten, should be respective PDB chains K&L, N&O. 
  In Fig. S4.19 F1* should be F1. And in Fig. S4.23 F1 should be F1*.

  Fig. S4:24: Figure text F1 should be F1*.
  
  Fig. S4.10(c): B-factors for CF6CEB(NO) vertical lines and label for chain A are meant to be coloured as red, and chain B as blue.
