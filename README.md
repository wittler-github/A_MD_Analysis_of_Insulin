## Welcome to this information, script and data repository for doctoral Thesis "A Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin"

Additional information, scripts and data as pertains to a number of publications as relating to Molecular Dynamics Analyses of Insulin or Analysis of related protein systems.

Published Thesis link DOI will soon appear here

Typo or data corrections for Thesis "A Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin", all else I believe are consistent, please email me if otherwise:

Table 6.3, Figure S6.38: All HB criterias is of course calculated within each time-frame separetely; rDA < 3.5 Ã… & phi < 30, or 60, or 90 (not with ensemble average).

Some figure's (5.10,5.11, 6.15, 6.16) have AD bold in rAD, where only the "r" should be bold due to being a vector, "A" and "D" just refers that distance is between Acceptor and Donor atom.



Currently not uploaded all scripts or data, but can be added on request.



The data for The 1.5us MD simulation of solvated insulin may be deposited also at https://welcome.gpcrmd.org/
