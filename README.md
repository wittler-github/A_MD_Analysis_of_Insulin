### Further explanation, typo and  data corrections for Thesis "A Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin"


#### Further explanations or elaboration:

- The Figures with zoomable (up to 6400%) vector graphics in EMF format are: 4.4., 4.5, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, S4.4, S.4.6, S4.7, S4.8, S4.9, S4.10, S4.11, S4.12, S4.13, S4.14,  S4.16, S4.17, S4.18, S4.20, S4.21, S4.22, S4.24, S4.25, S4.26, S5.27, S5.29, S5.30, S6.31, S6.37, S6.39, S6.40, S6.41, S6.42, S6.43.

- Figure 7.1 were made in VMD with placing the PDB structures in the centre of a square bilayer membrane being centrered in a rectangular box, the angle of view is hence seen from one of the rectangle sides, with half-membrane facing viewer is transparent, the other half-membrane in atomic representation (carbon green, hydrogen white, polar/charged atoms in purple). 

#### Typographical errors ; all is otherwise consistent, please email me if seeing any discrepancy.
