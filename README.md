#### Further explanation, typo and  data corrections for Thesis "A Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin"


##### Further explanations or elaboration:

- *The Figures with zoomable (up to 6400%) vector graphics in EMF format are: 4.4., 4.5, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, S4.4, S.4.6, S4.7, S4.8, S4.9, S4.10, S4.11, S4.12, S4.13, S4.14,  S4.16, S4.17, S4.18, S4.20, S4.21, S4.22, S4.24, S4.25, S4.26, S5.27, S5.29, S5.30, S6.31, S6.37, S6.39, S6.40, S6.41, S6.42, S6.43.

- *Figure 7.1 were made with placing the PDB structures in the centre of a membrane, centrered in a rectangular box, the angle of view is hence seen from one of the rectangle sides, with half-membrane facing viewer is transparent, the other half-membrane in atomic representation (carbon green, hydrogen white, polar/charged atoms in purple). 

##### Miswritten text (unseen before publishing; note that it is a 269 page document with intricate details; all is otherwise consistent, please email me if seeing any discrepancy)

- *These related figures show correct nomenclature and numbering, just a few typos in following method and figure captions text:
  
  *Method S4.2.1.1: PDB 6HN5, Insulin has 25 residues in B-chain (not 26). PDB 6CE9, aCT* are designated for chain P (aCT for chain M).
                   
  *Fig. S4.10(c): For CF6CEB(NO) vertical lines and label for chain A are to be coloured as red, and chain B as blue.

  *Fig. S4.13, S4.14, S4.16, S4.17, S.4.24: The colour, label and domain names are correctly written in figure-labels, however part of captions has wrong details of which receptor monomer (marked with or without asterisk).

  *Fig. S4.19, S4.23: Phrase "(lime-green, chain A; ochre-brown, chain B)" miswritten, should be respective PDB chains K&L, N&O. In Fig. S4.19 F1* should be F1. And in Fig. S4.23 F1 should be F1*.
